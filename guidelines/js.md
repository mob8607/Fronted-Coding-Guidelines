## JavaScript Coding Guidelines

### Spacing


### Comments

#### Block Comments
All block comments are written in a YUIDoc like style.
The actual content of the comment is intended by 4 spaces.
Between the description and the properties is a line break.
    /**
        My awesome comment

        @param {String}
        @return {Object} MyCoolObject
    */

#### Inline Comments
We use inline comments inside class methods.
    {
        myMethod: function() {
            // Dat inline comment
            // is splitted into 2 lines
        } 
    }

### Single or Double Quotes ?
Single quotes are much more seksy. 
    var text = 'My text',
        myOtherText = 'This time we use "double quotes" in our text.';
